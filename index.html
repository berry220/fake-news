        <p>While Googling “fake news”, the results that came up were: “fake news article simulator”, “fake news generator”, “fake news detector”. These days fake news if very easy to fabricate. And with all the current social media platforms, it is very easy to spread to a large audience. People get very compelled to believe what is being spread. Because fake news is very compelling is why it is very dangerous. Some might not see fae news as being a big issue. And say that people who do fall for fake news, just need to be more careful and do their research. This can be hard for the elderly or children who aren’t as tech savvy/or are naïve. Children and the elderly are the primary demographic that tend to fall for fake news. It is not always that easy to determine what exactly is fake news.  Fake news can be made in a way that really makes it seem like it is true. This is what makes it dangerous.</p>

        <p>The definition of fake news is pretty much in the name. Fake-News. False/misleading information presented by the media, or an individual. Fake news can be made with the intention of deceiving others in order to gain something. </p>

        <h2>Why people fall for fake news?</h2>
        <p>People fall for fake news because it reinforces a person’s own bias of what they already believe in, fake news is always sensational, it isn’t boring. Fake news also appeals to our emotions, clickbait, implicit bias, confirmation bias. As stated in the beginning the main demographic that tend to fall for fake news are the elderly/young that tend to fall for fake news. Fake news uses rhetoric’s in many was to intrigue people to believe in it. By using logos, ethos, pathos, detecting bias’s etc. This is why fake news is so compelling. Because of the way it is presented; it's presented in a way that makes it so beliveable. </p>

        <h2>Why fake news is dangerous?</h2>
        <p> FAKE NEWS IS A CRISIS. In our latest election, the own president of the United States, spread fake news about mail-in ballots. How can fake news is not a crisis when it started affecting democracy. The government, people’s lives? Fake news is not just limited to harmless headlines of celebrities dating/breaking up. It brings harsher consequences.

        <h3>A closer look into a fake news story:</h3>
        <p>
            Let’s focus on a fake news story about Trump's false claims on voter fraud. Kelly SoRelle a Republican from Texas shot a video of a man closing the doors of a white van and then rolling a wagon with a large box into a Detroit election center. This video circulated the internet and spread large speculation about fraud in the election. The video was viewed by over a MILLION people. It was even tweeted/shared by Eric Trump on November 4th “WATCH: Suitcases and Coolers Rolled Into Detroit Voting Center at 4 AM, Brought Into Secure Counting Area” This one 90-second video was more fuel to the fire of the speculations about voter fraud. It really leaves a scar on American Democracy, because "there will always be people who believe the 2020 election was stolen."-Jeniffer Mercieca a historian of political rhetoric at Texas A&M University. Despite their being no evidence of widespread fraud and election officials confirming there was no irregularities in the election. Many still believe that there was (voter fraud) due to the misinformation that is still coming from Trump. Due to the constant repition about voter fraud "There's two benefits of the repition...People are more likley to remember something...increases belief in a claim"- Lisa Fazio a psychology professor at Vanderbilt University.  </p>
